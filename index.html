            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <h3>A. Coursework and ePortfolio Development Impact</h3>
            <p>Throughout my Computer Science program, I gained significant practical experience that helped showcase my strengths and prepare me for a career in the tech industry. In my CS 465 Full Stack Development course, I worked extensively with MongoDB and JavaScript, which taught me effective ways to handle data and enhance web applications. For instance, I developed a project where I utilized MongoDB to store and retrieve data dynamically, integrating it with a front-end created with JavaScript to build a responsive web application.</p>
            <p>Another critical aspect of my development was during my CS 305 course, where I focused on identifying and resolving vulnerabilities in databases and refactoring existing code to improve efficiency and security. This involved reviewing and revising SQL queries and database schemas to ensure they were not only optimized for performance but also secure from potential threats.</p>

            <h3>B. Professional Skills in IT and Software Development</h3>
            <p>In my daily role as an IT specialist, collaboration and communication are crucial. I regularly participate in meetings with the IT team to strategize on implementing new projects. A recent example includes setting up a new phone system using Twilio, which required intensive collaboration with developers to integrate the system's data reporting with our SQL server. This task highlighted my ability to work effectively with diverse teams to deliver technology solutions that meet our organizational needs.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I manage hardware inventory and engage in managerial meetings across departments to address any tech-related issues they face, ensuring smooth operation and support throughout the organization. My routine tasks also include reviewing stack traces and using PowerShell scripting to automate server patches, which further underscores my technical skills and problem-solving abilities.</p>

            <h3>C. Summary of Artifacts and Skills</h3>
            <p>The artifacts in my ePortfolio, such as the C++ game project and the Twilio phone system setup, demonstrate a wide range of skills from coding to system integration. In the C++ game project, I wrote detailed functions like <code>updateAnimations()</code> to manage real-time interactions within the game. This required a deep understanding of C++ programming, including memory management and object-oriented design.</p>
            <p>Additionally, to showcase the project and document the development process, I utilized HTML and CSS to create a GitHub Pages site. This not only involved coding but also designing a user-friendly interface that effectively displays the project details and my coding prowess.</p>
            <p>Each project within this ePortfolio reflects my comprehensive skill set, from software development to database management and beyond. They illustrate my ability to tackle complex technical challenges and my commitment to enhancing the functionality and security of software solutions.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, this ePortfolio serves as a testament to my growth and readiness to contribute effectively in a professional environment, demonstrating a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science.</p>
