            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>Throughout my Computer Science program and while developing this ePortfolio, I have built essential skills in C++ programming and SQL database integration. These skills are showcased in my capstone project, where I developed an animation-based game using C++. This project demonstrates my ability to handle complex software development tasks, including writing C++ code for dynamic animation sequences and managing game data with SQL databases. For instance, in the <code>MainCode.cpp</code> file, I wrote code that handles frame-by-frame updates based on user interactions, reflecting my understanding of software mechanics and real-time processing.</p>
            <p>My coursework and this ePortfolio have helped me showcase my strengths, shape my professional goals and values, and prepare to enter the computer science field. In my CS 465 Full Stack Development course, I worked with MongoDB and JavaScript, which enhanced my skills in managing databases and developing web applications. Additionally, in my CS 305 course, I focused on clearing vulnerabilities from databases and refactoring code, which strengthened my understanding of secure coding practices.</p>
            <p>As an IT specialist, I regularly collaborate with developers and other IT staff. I manage our virtual machines, apply patches, and review stack traces. I also work with developers to create our SIP phone system using Twilio and ensure that reporting data is sent to our SQL server. Daily meetings with the IT team and managers across departments help me address any issues and plan new projects. I also perform inventory of our hardware and script automated server patches using PowerShell.</p>
            <p>Completing the ePortfolio involved integrating various technologies, such as HTML and CSS for creating the GitHub Pages, and SQL for managing the game data. Debugging and testing the integrated application presented significant challenges, particularly in ensuring efficient database operations without slowing down the application. These experiences have honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of C++ and SQL integration.</p>
            <p>Overall, this ePortfolio demonstrates my technical skills across coding, database management, and problem-solving within software projects. As I move into the professional field, I am prepared to apply my skills in C++ and SQL to tackle more complex software development challenges, enhancing both functionality and efficiency in future projects. I aim to bring these skills to potential employers, demonstrating my readiness to contribute effectively in technology-driven environments.</p>
