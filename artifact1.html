            <h2>Brief Description</h2>
            <p>The artifact I chose to fix for my first milestone was my animation project code for my CS 330 class. This code was created last term in the last week of the class. The code consists of a paddle, a ball, and a few bricks that can be hit. The first version of the code basically just had the user press the space bar and a few circles would start to bounce around the screen and hit the bricks. The bricks would change color and disappear if they were hit by the circles.</p>

            <h2>Justification</h2>
            <p>I included this artifact because it shows my ability to use math, data structures, and programming logic to create a simple animated game with basic physics. It shows my proficiency in C++ and my understanding of pointers and implementing physics into a piece of code. It also shows my ability to comment and create readable code. Lastly it shows my ability to structure code in a logical manner and optimize its performance through the use of smart pointers. When I first created the code there was a few issues with edge detection and randomization of the circles. There was also issues with the bricks not breaking after being hit a few times. Also the bricks were not one solid piece. With my improved version I was able to add comments to explain functionality, I was also able to reorganize the code using modularization, I also created a single destructible brick that has to be hit by the ball. I took out the changing colors as well since this was too distracting. Lastly I fixed the detection so the ball goes in a predictable direction.</p>

            <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
            <p>I believe that I met the course objectives and was able to improve the overall functionality in a way that aligns with the outcomes I desire. I was able to fix some aspects of it that did not work originally like the ball not properly bouncing (I had to simplify the collision detection loop and also add better checks to check for boundaries). In terms of updating my outcome-coverage I do not think I need to at this point since it is going as planned.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Throughout the enhancement process, I learned the importance of robust collision detection and handling edge cases to ensure a smooth user experience. I also gained a deeper understanding of memory management in C++ by implementing smart pointers. Additionally, I learned how to effectively use the GLFW library for real-time graphics rendering and input handling. One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring that the ball did not get stuck in the corners or exhibit erratic behavior during collisions. This required careful adjustment of the collision detection logic and fine-tuning the ball's trajectory adjustments. Another challenge was managing the complexity of the code while ensuring it remained readable and maintainable, which I addressed by adding detailed comments and documentation.</p>
